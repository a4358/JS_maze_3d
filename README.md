# JS_maze_3d
educational javascript project

I had a lot of fun working on this project, even tho I had to rush it in the last week due to having external issues earlier. The general planning was a breeze, once I sat down to write code I already knew what kind of structure most of my classes and methods and functions would have. It was also really cool to see almost all algorithms work the first or second time I ran them, and so was seeing in practice how and why they perform differently in different circumstances. The final hours of the project were the best, I put in almost everything I wanted to. You could even say I had a bit of feature creep happen, and this would probably do fine without speed controls or low-res mode or smart drawing/hiding of solution path representation. Also, my main script turned out a little bloated, I should have probably partitioned some of it's functions into other files. Another mistake I made is relying too much on my string representation and not writing a different graphics mechanism for the web page earlier. The bug I spent the most time on is an export that appeared faulty, but the actual problem was that I put () after a function name in an event handler.

Overall this project has made me feel much more confident with javascript and is probably the most complex thing I have ever written, and I feel powerful. I do however realise that I am still very very far from perfection.
